Always remember, whenever u encounter a problem which seems a application of sliding window
try to think both ways i.e. maybe ans lies within the window range or outside the windwo range

class Solution {
    public int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        int n = cardPoints.length;
        int l = 0;
        int maxi = 0;
        int total = 0;

        for(int num : cardPoints) total += num;

        for(int r=-1; r<n && l<n;){
            while(r-l+1 < n-k){
                r++;
                sum += r<n ? cardPoints[r] : 0;
            }
            if(r<n && r-l+1 == n-k){
                maxi = Math.max(maxi, (total-sum));
            }
            
            sum -= cardPoints[l];
            l++;
        }

        return maxi;
    }
}
